# CIBP
Boilerplate for crushing it, 2015.

This is a boilerplate for utilizing Grunt to enforce my Javascript coding style rules, lint all Javascript, compile and minify SASS files any time a JS or .scss file is modified. 

The default Grunt command will do all the mentioned above plus minify JS in a build folder with a date/time-stamped directory. This part still needs a bit of work.

##Dependencies:
1. NPM (Node Package Manager) https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node

##Steps to use:
1. Clone repository.
2. In project root 'npm install'. 
3. In project root 'grunt watch'.
4. That's all.

When issues are encountered by any of the tasks, a desktop notification will appear to alert you to that fact.
